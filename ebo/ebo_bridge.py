ebo_bridge.py — EBO Air 2 ⇆ Home Assistant bridge.

Establishes the robot control session (RTM login + RTC join, like the app), then:
  - publishes telemetry as Home Assistant entities via MQTT Discovery
  - receives commands from HA (speed, laser, movement) and forwards them to the robot
  - keeps a 10 Hz movement loop with a watchdog (dead-man's switch)

Autonomous: with EBO_EMAIL/EBO_PASSWORD it logs into the Enabot cloud, discovers the
robot, gets the Agora tokens and renews them by itself before expiry (~24h). No
emulator, no session.json. See docs/STATO.md.

Config via env:
  EBO_EMAIL, EBO_PASSWORD          the user's Enabot credentials (autonomous)
  EBO_REGION=GB                    account region
  EBO_ROBOT_ID                     optional: if the account has more than one robot
  EBO_MQTT_HOST, EBO_MQTT_PORT=1883, EBO_MQTT_USER, EBO_MQTT_PASS
